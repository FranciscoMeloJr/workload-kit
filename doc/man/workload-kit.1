workload-kit \(em Toolbox to generate traces with known features

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Workload-kit is a set of scripts and executables to generate a trace set with
known features. Each trace produced have some characteristics that can be used
as input for integration tests of trace analysis algorithms. For example, a
trace with an executable that computes in a busy loop for one second can be
used to test the CPU usage recovery algorithm.

.PP
Workload scripts are under "/usr/share/workload-kit/scripts". These scripts can
be traced with lttng-simple(1) in batch mode. The generated traces forms the
trace set.

.PP
Workload scripts uses many executables that have prefix \fB\wk\-\fP. Some
executables are instrumented with UST. They are also depends on cpuburn, netcat
and dd.
