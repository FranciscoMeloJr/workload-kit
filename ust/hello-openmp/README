This is a multi-threaded version of the "hello" test program. It uses OpenMP for
parallelization, and as such requires at least GCC 4.2.

You can pass one integer as argument when running the program, this will
indicate how many threads to use. For example

./hello 10

will run the test with 10 threads. If no argument is passed, the default of
1 thread is used, in which case the behaviour should be similar to the original
"hello" program.
