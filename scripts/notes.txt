# commands to run lttng cluster

# some paths are hard coded and must be adjusted. The main setup uses KVM
# virtual machines controled by SSH on an ethernet bridge. At boot, a script
# sends the IP address of the client to the host, because addresses are
# allocated by DHCP. Files can be transfered after the tracing with rsync. 

# needs dhcp3-server ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils qemu-kvm rsync sshfs dsh and probably others

# start virtual network
sudo kvm-net

# start cluster
sudo ./start-ltt-cluster.sh

# verify quorum
dsh -c -f members uptime

# prepare lttng
dsh -c -f members /ltt/bench/scripts/load-modules.sh 
dsh -c -f members ltt-armall -n

# do the trace of pingpong
dsh -c -f members /ltt/bench/scripts/trace-cmd-cluster.sh /ltt/bench/scripts/pingpong.py -f /ltt/cluster/members

# load the trace in lttv
./lttv-cluster /srv/ltt/traces
