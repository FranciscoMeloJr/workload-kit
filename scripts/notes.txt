# commands to run lttng cluster

# some paths are hard coded and must be adjusted. The main setup uses KVM
# virtual machines controled by SSH on an ethernet bridge. At boot, a script
# sends the IP address of the client to the host, because addresses are
# allocated by DHCP. Files can be transfered after the tracing with rsync. 
# Scripts are shared to client machines with NFS. On fstab on the client:
#
# 172.16.0.1:/srv/ltt /ltt nfs soft 0 0
# 
# On the server:
#
# /srv 172.16.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
#
# make scripts available in this directory. 

# needs dhcp3-server ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils qemu-kvm rsync sshfs dsh nfs-kernel-server and probably others on the host, ssh on host and client
